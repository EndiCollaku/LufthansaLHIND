# DevOps Bootcamp @ Lufthansa Industry Solutions (LHIND)

## 📍 Overview
From **April to July 2025**, I participated in an intensive **DevOps Bootcamp** hosted by **Lufthansa Industry Solutions (LHIND)**. The program was designed to provide hands-on experience across the entire DevOps lifecycle — from infrastructure provisioning to deployment automation, monitoring, and cloud-native operations.

The training consisted of multiple modules, each combining theoretical foundations with real-world project work. The program culminated in deploying cloud-native applications on Azure using CI/CD pipelines and container orchestration tools.
